# üì± @helius-labs/xray-app
A SvelteKit app that contains the main X-Ray UI and various endpoints used for viewing blockchain data.

## Important Files & Folders
|||
|-|-|
üìÅ `./src/lib` | Common components, utilities, and libraries used throughout the app. Import things from this directory using the `$lib/` alias. |
üìÅ`./src/routes` | Any `+page` or `+server` file in this directory becomes a page or an endpoint based on the folder structure. |
üìÅ`./src/routes` | Any `+page` or `+server` file in this directory becomes a page or an endpoint based on the folder structure. |
üìÅ`./static` | A place to put any static assets. The files in this directory are hosted at the root of the domain. When using images, try to import them in the `<script>` vs put them in `./static` when you can help it. |
üìÑ`./app.postcss` | Initialize/config Tailwind + global styles. |
üìÑ`./app.html` | The top level HTML template that wrapps all pages. Routes are injected into the  `%sveltekit.body%` tag. |

## Routes
|||
|-|-|
`/` | Home |
`/api` | REST endpoints |
`/[search]` | From the home page, users can navigate to `/anything` which attempts to resolve the search and then redirect them to `/[search]/tx`, `/[search]/wallet`, or `/[search]/token` based on the search. |
`/[search]/tx` | Details about a particular transaction where `[search]` is a transaction signature. |
`/[search]/wallet` | Details about a particular wallet where `[search]` is a public key. |
`/[search]/token` | Details about a particular token where `[search]` is a token mint address. |

## Vercel Config
|||
|-|-|
Build Command | `cd ../.. && npx turbo run build --filter=web...` |
Output Director | `apps/web/.svelte-kit` |
Install Command | `npm install --prefix=../..` |

## Styles
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for base utilies and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) contains helpful UI components.

## Icons
See list of available icons at `$lib/icons/index.ts`.

### Use Icons
```js
<script>
    import Icon from "$lib/icon";
</script>

<Icon id="paper-plane">
```

### Add Icons
1. Find the icon you want on [IconMon](https://iconmonstr.com/). Most of these should render fine. 
2. Click "Embed" -> "Inline" and copy only the `<path>`.
3. Add a new key to `$lib/icons/index.ts` that is similar to the Icon Monsters name for the icon and add your `<path>`.

## State Management
State is managed using a custom library located in `$lib/state`.

### Queries
A query is a definition that contains an ID + some options on how to fetch data. This lib uses a combination of query definations and Svelte stores to create easy to load, subscribable and organized state. 

### Provider
To access query state in components, your app needs to be wrapped with `<QueryProvider>` which provides state to any components underneath it.
```html
<script>
    import { QueryProvider } from "$lib/state";
</script>

<QueryProvider>
    <nav>...</nav>
    <main class="min-h-screen">
        ...
    </main>
</QueryProvider>
```

### Use Queries
Using queries is as easy as importing them as a store and subscribing with Sveltes `$`.
```html
<script>
    import query from "$lib/state";

    const price = query("solana-price");
</script>

{#if $price.isLoading}
    Loading...
{:else if $price.isError}
    Error: {$price.error}
{:else if $price.hasFetched}
    Price: {$price.data}
{/if}
```

### Register Queries
To fetch data, there needs to be a query for it. See registered queries in `$lib/state/queries`.
#### Add Query
1. Add a new key to the queries object with the ID you want to subcribe to your query with.
2. Supply a loader function which should be a function that returns a Promise. Whatever is resolved will become the query value.
3. Optional: Add a `formatter` function for the returned data to pass through. This should also be a function that returns a Promise.
3. Optional: `fetchOnFirstSubscription`, if your loader function doesn't require any arguments, you can supply this option which will fetch data as soon as a part of your app subscribes to the query store.
```js
import getSolanaPrice from "$lib/state/actions/get-solana-price";

import formatMoney from "$lib/util/format-money";

const queries:Queries = {
    "solana-price" : {
        loader                   : getSolanaPrice,
        formatter                : formatMoney,
        fetchOnFirstSubscription : true,
    },

    ...
}
```

### Dynamic Queries
Pass data to your queries load function like so.
```html
<script>
    import query from "$lib/state";

    const transactions = query("solana-account-transactions");

    $: if($transactions?.load) {
        $transactions.load($page.params.search);
    }
</script>
```

### Reloading Queries
You can access your loader function on any query store at `$myQuery.load()`. This makes it easy to reload a certain query throughout the app. Any components that are subscribed to the reloaded query will be updated.

# üì¶ @helius-labs/proton
Used for parsing blockchain data and making it pretty for the UI.

## Important Files & Folders
|||
|-|-|
üìÅ`./src/parsers` | All parser methods that turn Helius EnrichedTransaction API calls into more easily readable objects for the UI depending on the transaction type. |
üìÑ`./src/parsers/index.ts` | Export new parser functions here. |
üìÑ`./src/types/index.ts` | Displays all supported transaction types with parsing and the interface returned from every parser function. Add new transaction w/ parsers to the supportedTransactions object. |
üìÑ`./index.ts` | File where all transactions are parsed through. Import new parser functions here and add the transaction type with the corresponding function to the parsers object. |

## General Work Flow When Adding a New Transaction Type
1. Identify a transaction type that is not currently supported. 
    - [Helius API Docs](https://docs.helius.xyz/reference/transaction-types) - View all transaction types supported by Helius.
2. Get to know the transaction type. Here is the resource I personally like to use for it:
    - [SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Helius/HeliusAPI/1.1.0#/Transactions/getEnrichedTransactions) - Use `/v0/addresses/{address}/transactions ` for addresses with the specific transaction type or `/v0/transactions/` for a transaction (also supports multiple transactions). I like downloading the JSON file and looking through it constantly. More transactions + edge cases are better to battle test your parser function. 
2. Add a new file in `./src/parsers` with the name of the transaction type. (refer to other files for general structures of what a parser function should look like)
3. Export the function in `./src/parsers/index.ts`, add the transaction type to the `supportedTransactions` object in `./src/types/index.ts`, and add the transaction type with the corresponding parser function to the `parsers` object in `./index.ts`.
4. Work on the parser function while testing it since it is now compatible with the UI.

## Currently Supported Transactions 
|||
| - | - |
| **Transaction Type** | **File in `/src/parsers`** |
| TRANSFER | `/transfer.ts` |
| SWAP | `/swap.ts` |
